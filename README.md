# CraftBeerPi_BoilStepWithHopDropperAndPump
A boil step that allows the timed activation of actors during the boil.
This is a variation to the BoilStepWithHopDropper plugin by Manuel Fritsch.
This version allows to assign two different actors to a boil step, and then choose the desired actor to activate in each time point. 
For example: Use a hop dropper in each hop addition, and activate the pump 10 minutes before the end of the boil, to reciculate boiling wort through the counter flow chiller in order to sterilize it. 

This plugin still adds the HopDropper actor as an available actor type.
